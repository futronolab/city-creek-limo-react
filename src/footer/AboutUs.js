                    in the luxury resorts of the Wasatch Mountains, including Sundance, Deer Valley Resort, 
                    Stein Eriksen Lodge and The Grand America Hotel. Itâ€™s no secret that Utah has the 
                    greatest snow on Earth. But through Robert's interactions at these renowned 
                    destinations, he recognized that one of the greatest amenities this beautiful 
                    state can offer its visitors is superior, "Five Star" guest service.
